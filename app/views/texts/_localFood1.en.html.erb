Commonly, “local food” refers to food produced near the consumer. However, because there is no universally agreed-upon definition for the geographic component of what “local” or “regional” means, consumers are left to decide what that means to them. <br />
Based on sustainabletable.org information, a 2008 survey found that half of consumers described local as “made or produced within a hundred miles” of their homes, while another 37% described local as “made or produced in my state”. The ability to eat “locally” also varies depending on the production capacity of the region in question.
