We assume that local food is the one produced not further than the borders of your administrative state. This is why it is fresher, tastes better and lasts longer than the food that has been trucked or shipped from thousands of kilometers away. It also usually has less environmental impact and supports your local economy. That is why we encourage to taste a difference and make a difference to people growing food near you and the whole planet.
