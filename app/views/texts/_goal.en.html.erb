We want to support sustainable consumption in our society. Nullkilometer.org provides an interactive map to easily find local food products. 
<br />
We believe in locally based, self-reliant food economies - ones in which sustainable food production, processing, distribution, and consumption are integrated to enhance the economic, environmental and social health of a particular region. 
<br />
Our goal is to show you local food spots near you.
